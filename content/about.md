Hi, I'm a software engineer with over 4 years of experience building scalable backend systems and cloud-native applications.

I mostly work with TypeScript and Go, with a strong focus on developer experience, API design, and good architecture. I've worked across various domains such as edtech, fintech, and blockchain/crypto, shipping products that handle real money, real users, and real-world complexity. I care about reliability, clarity, and performance.

Outside work when I'm not writing code, I am inside my house.
