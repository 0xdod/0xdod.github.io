Hi, I'm a software engineer with over 4 years of experience building scalable backend systems and cloud-native applications.

I mostly work with TypeScript and Go, with a strong focus on developer experience, API design, and distributed systems. I've worked across edtech, fintech, crypto, and infrastructure-focused teams, shipping products that handle real money, real users, and real-world complexity.

Beyond writing code, I love building platforms: designing systems that empower others to build, automate, and scale with confidence. I care about reliability, clarity, and performance.

When I'm not coding, I'm learning, daydreaming about side-projects, and quietly obsessing over good architecture.
