Hello! I'm Damilola

I work as a software engineer during the day and fight crime in my neighborhood at night ü¶á.
I have been writing software professionally since 2021, working mostly with Typescript (NestJS) and Go.
In recent times, I have been investing my time learning about cloud technologies and DevOps practices, picking up 2 AWS certifications in the process (I'm not bragging üòé).

I also love to read about system architecture, algorithms, blockchain and crypto technologies, and exploring new programming languages (like I'm learning [Zig](https://ziglang.org/learn/) just for the plot).

You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/0xdod), [GitHub](https://github.com/0xdod), [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/damilola-dolor97).

I am a lukewarm Chelsea FC supporter, failed game developer, failed music producer and lastly and more importantly I use neovim with tmux btw!‚úåüèø
