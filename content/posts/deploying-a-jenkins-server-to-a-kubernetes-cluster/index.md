> _Part 2 of the **10 Kubernetes Projects in 10 Weeks** challenge_

Welcome to the second project in my Kubernetes project series! This time, we're deploying **Jenkins**‚Äîa powerful CI/CD automation server, to a kubernetes cluster.

The goal here is to understand how persistent storage is managed in kubernetes.

Stateful apps like Jenkins need to store data across pod restarts like pipeline configurations, plugins, and credentials. We'll achieve that using **Persistent Volumes (PV)** and **Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)** in Kubernetes.

## Prerequisites

- [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)
- [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) 
- Basic familiarity with Kubernetes concepts (Pods, Services, Deployments)

The code for this project can be found in this [repo](https://github.com/0xdod/kubernetes-practice/tree/main/jenkins-ci-cd)

## Why Persistent Storage for Jenkins?

Jenkins is a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) automation server. It stores a lot of critical data:

- **Build history:** Logs, artifacts, and results of past builds.
    
- **Configuration:** Job definitions, plugin settings, user credentials.
    
- **Plugins:** Installed and configured plugins.
    
- **Workspaces:** Temporary data used during builds.
    

Without persistent storage, if a Jenkins pod restarts (due to an update, node failure, or scaling event), all this data would be lost, effectively resetting your Jenkins instance. Since container storage is ephemeral, we need a way to persist data across pod restarts, this is where PVs and PVCs come into play.


## Understanding Persistent Volumes (PVs)

Think of a **Persistent Volume (PV)** as a piece of storage in your cluster that can be statically or dynamically provisioned. It's a cluster-wide resource, independent of any specific pod.

A PV abstracts the underlying storage infrastructure. It could be:

- NFS (Network File System) share
    
- iSCSI
    
- Cloud-specific storage (AWS EBS, Google Persistent Disk, Azure Disk)
    
- Local storage (as we'll use in Minikube for demonstration)
    

Key characteristics of a PV include:

- **Capacity:** How much storage it provides (e.g., 5Gi).
    
- **Access Modes:** How the storage can be mounted (e.g., `ReadWriteOnce` for single-node access, `ReadOnlyMany` for multiple read-only consumers, `ReadWriteMany` for multiple read-write consumers).
    
- **Reclaim Policy:** What happens to the volume when the PVC using it is deleted (e.g., `Retain`, `Recycle`, `Delete`).
    

## Understanding Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs)

While a PV is the actual storage resource, a **Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)** is a request for storage by a user or an application. It's like a consumer requesting a specific type and amount of storage.

A PVC specifies:

- **Amount of storage:** How much space is needed.
    
- **Access modes:** The desired way to access the storage.
    
- **Storage Class (optional but recommended):** A way to describe "classes" of storage (e.g., "fast-ssd", "backup-hdd").
    

Kubernetes then tries to find a suitable PV that matches the PVC's requirements. Once a PV is found and bound to a PVC, that PV is exclusively reserved for that PVC.

A PV is like an empty apartment building (the physical storage). A PVC is like a tenant requesting an apartment with specific features (size, number of rooms). Kubernetes then assigns an available apartment (PV) that matches the tenant's request (PVC).


## Minikube Setup

For this project, we'll use Minikube, a tool that runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster locally. Minikube makes it easy to experiment with Kubernetes features without needing a full-blown cluster. It also supports local persistent volumes, which is perfect for our demonstration.

Ensure your Minikube cluster is running: 
```bash
minikube start
```

In another terminal, start the tunnel for our load balancer service that we would use later on.

```bash
minikube tunnel
```


## Deploying Jenkins with PV/PVC

Let's define our Kubernetes resources. We'll create three YAML files: one for the PV, one for the PVC, and one for the Jenkins Deployment and Service.

### 1. Persistent Volume (PV) Definition

This PV will use Minikube's host path, meaning it will store data directly on the Minikube VM's filesystem. This is suitable for local testing but not for production.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: jenkins-pv
  labels:
    type: local
spec:
  storageClassName: manual
  capacity:
    storage: 8Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  local:
    path: "/tmp/data"
```

### 2. Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) Definition

This PVC will request 2Gi of storage with `ReadWriteOnce` access, matching our PV.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: jenkins-pvc
spec:
  storageClassName: manual
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 2Gi
```


This PVC will look for a PV with the `manual` storage class and request 2GB of storage.
    

### 3. Jenkins Deployment and Service

This defines our Jenkins deployment, which will use the PVC, and a Service to expose Jenkins.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: jenkins-deploy
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: jenkins
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: jenkins
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: jenkins
        image:  jenkins/jenkins:lts-jdk17
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
          hostPort: 8080
        - containerPort: 50000
          hostPort: 50000
        volumeMounts:
        - name: jenkins-data
          mountPath: /var/jenkins_home
      volumes:
      - name: jenkins-data
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: jenkins-pvc
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: jenkins-svc
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - name: jenkins-agents-controller-port
    port: 50000
    targetPort: 50000
  - name: jenkins-server-port
    port: 8080
    targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    app: jenkins
```


The `volumeMounts` section mounts the `jenkins-home` volume at `/var/jenkins_home` inside the container, which is where Jenkins expects its data to be.

The `volumes` section defines the `jenkins-home` volume and links it to our `jenkins-pvc` using `persistentVolumeClaim: claimName: jenkins-pvc`.

        
## Steps to Deploy

1. **Save the YAML files:** Save the content above into `jenkins-pv.yaml`, `jenkins-pvc.yaml`, and `jenkins-deployment.yaml` respectively.
    
2. **Apply the PV:**
    
    ```
    kubectl apply -f jenkins-pv.yaml
    ```
    
    Verify it's created and available:
    
    ```
    kubectl get pv
    ```
    
    You should see `jenkins-pv` with status `Available`.
    
3. **Apply the PVC:**
    
    ```
    kubectl apply -f jenkins-pvc.yaml
    ```
    
    Verify it's created and bound:
    
    ```
    kubectl get pvc
    ```
    
    You should see `jenkins-pvc` with status `Bound` to `jenkins-pv`.
    
4. **Apply the Jenkins Deployment and Service:**
    
    ```
    kubectl apply -f jenkins-deployment.yaml
    ```
    
    Monitor the deployment:
    
    ```
    kubectl get pods -l app=jenkins -w
    ```
    
    Wait until the Jenkins pod is `Running` and `Ready`. This might take a few minutes as Jenkins downloads plugins and initializes.
    

## Verification

Once the Jenkins pod is running, you can access it via your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.
    

You should see the Jenkins setup wizard. Go through the initial setup (you can find the initial admin password by checking the pod logs: `kubectl logs <jenkins-pod-name>`).

**To test persistence:**

1. Complete the Jenkins setup, create a sample job, or install a plugin.
    
2. Delete the Jenkins pod:
    
    ```
    kubectl delete pod -l app=jenkins
    ```
    
    Kubernetes will automatically create a new pod for the deployment.
    
3. Once the new pod is running, refresh your browser. You should find your Jenkins instance exactly as you left it, with all your configurations, jobs, or installed plugins intact. This confirms that the persistent storage is working!
    

## Conclusion

This week, we successfully deployed a Jenkins server on Minikube, demonstrating the critical role of Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) in managing stateful applications in Kubernetes. You've learned:

- Why persistent storage is essential for applications like Jenkins.
    
- The distinction between a cluster-wide PV (the actual storage) and a user-requested PVC (the claim for storage).
    
- How to define and link PVs and PVCs in your Kubernetes manifests.
    
- How to configure a Deployment to use a PVC for its data.
    

This foundational understanding of persistent storage is vital as you continue your Kubernetes journey. Next week, we'll explore another exciting aspect of Kubernetes! ‚úåüèø
